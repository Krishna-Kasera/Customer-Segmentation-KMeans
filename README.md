# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Algorithm 🪚

This project aims to segment customers using KMeans clustering algorithm, enabling targeted marketing strategies and enhanced customer understanding. By leveraging advanced clustering techniques, we uncover patterns in customer behavior and propose actionable insights to optimize business outcomes. 📈

## Project Highlights 🔦
- 🔍 Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distributions, patterns & relationships between features.
- ⚖️ Used scree plots and silhouette scores to optimize cluster count and select the best clustering algorithm.
- ✂️ Applied K-Means algorithm to segment customers effectively.
- 💡 Visualized customer segments using radar plots for deeper insight.
- 🔧 Derived actionable recommendations based on segment characteristics.
